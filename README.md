# memeGenerator
This project is a Meme Generator that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in combination with CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) to generate memes based on a provided text input (caption). The GAN generates an image, and CLIP ensures the generated image aligns semantically with the input caption.
